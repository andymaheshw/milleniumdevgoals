## Status

### Entered the competition on Jul 30th, 2017. Currently at 146 out of 137.
* All I did was a simple average.

## Ideas for the future.
* Time Series Analysis?
* Analyze direction of movement, and apply a slight movement to all values for 2012?
* Could try linear regression since it is continuous.
